To compile the sourcecode you need to set the GP2XDEV environment variable and probably edit the Makefile present in the src folder.
This is an example environment:

# export GP2XDEV="/usr/local/gp2xdev"
# export PATH="$PATH:${GP2XDEV}/bin"

=== Installation ===
Create a directory on your sd or on the nand and put the file "gmenu2x" and the directories "screens", "icons", "scripts" and "sections" in there.
Then you have to create a autorun.gpu script to let the gp2x launch gmenu2x on startup.
The script should look something like this, assuming you installed gmenu2x in the directory gmenu2x on the sd:

#!/bin/sh
cd /mnt/sd/gmenu2x
exec ./gmenu2x
